# sl79toAL91
Procedure to migrate Scientific Linux 7.9 to Alma Linux 9.1

This document describes migration of SL7.9 to AL8.7 to AL91. Upgrade is a two steps process.

This procedure has worked only on SL79 Version downloaded and labeled SL-7-DVD-x86-64.iso.

Initial attempt to do this one with label "EVERYTHING" did not work. Mostly due to all the repo(s) that has been added to that release. 

This procedure has been developed and tested only on SL7.9 running on Windows 11 VM a PC Desktop.

Many places I had to hand edit and/or delete items after reading the logfiles.
